# Summary

UD Gheg Pear Stories (GPS) contains oral narrations of Chafe's  *Pear Stories* by heritage speakers of Gheg Albanian living in  Switzerland and speakers from Pristina.


# Introduction

UD Gheg GPS contains 967 sentences from 64 recordings of Gheg speakers re-narrating the *Pear Stories* video. Data collection was part of a bigger project and took place from [time] in Zurich, Pristina and Munich. Only recordings from Pristina und Zurich were included in the treebank. Speakers of different generations were interviewed, age ranging from 10 to 67. Sentence ids contain information on location (P for Pristina or Z for Zurich), Generation (G1, G2, G3) and a unique speaker id, all separated by hyphens, followed by an underscore and the sentence id, which starts at 1 for each interview. Due to the multilingual setting, the treebank contains many instances of code-switching (mostly Swiss-German). It also exhibits characteristics of (semi-)spontaneous speech, like disfluencies and corrections.

Since the treebank contains less than 20k tokens, it was not split into training and test set.
